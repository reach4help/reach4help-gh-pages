To mitigate this, many local groups and organizations, big and small, have started initiatives to try and get resources such as food and medicine to these people, and help out with important tasks such as walking dogs.\n\nUnfortunately, a number of these organizations are struggling with certain logistics, such as coordinating their volunteer workforce, prioritizing the most urgent requests, and ensuring that all requests get fulfilled.\n\nReach4Help is an open project that is completely run by volunteers that aims to address these issues, not only enabling those in need to receive help, but also enabling partner groups and organizations to help more efficiently by mobilizing their volunteers with the help of our own tracking and ticketing system.\n\nWeâ€™re part of [Helpful Engineering](https://www.helpfulengineering.org/), a collective of volunteers who have congregated to come up with solutions in the COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic, without any commercial goals."}},"profile":{"title":"Mate Logo","image":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/yganfevmefwf/6nf3rNaaVaUqYcoAcciSeC/6d000f6c6ff8cd1af2d1622ae6b9647a/Mate_Logo.png?w=450&fl=progressive&q=100"}}}}}
